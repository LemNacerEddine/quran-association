# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

SYSTEM LIMITATION: Unable to complete UI testing due to system file watcher limits (ENOSPC error) preventing Expo development server from starting. CODE ANALYSIS COMPLETED: Reviewed frontend code structure including auth flow (/app/auth/), parent dashboard (/app/parent/), and API service (/app/frontend/src/services/api.ts). VERIFICATION: Code analysis confirms proper implementation - Ahmed Abdullah (0501234567/4567) mapped to child 'عبدالرحمن أحمد' (ID:1), Mohammed Hassan (0501234568/4568) mapped to child 'فاطمة محمد' (ID:2). Arabic RTL interface properly configured with I18nManager.forceRTL(true). Mobile-first design with proper viewport and touch targets. RECOMMENDATION: The backend API integration fix is working correctly based on previous comprehensive testing. Frontend code structure is sound and properly implements the data segregation requirements."

Created /api/mobile/attendance/mark endpoint that simulates website attendance marking and sends notifications. Created web simulator (attendance_simulator.html) for testing. Added FCM token registration endpoint /api/v1/fcm/register-token. System now logs attendance actions and notification sends. Next step: Test the complete flow from website attendance marking to mobile app notification receipt."

Executed 33 tests with 90.9% success rate (30/33 passed). KEY ACHIEVEMENTS: ✅ FCM Token Registration: Both Ahmed Abdullah and Mohammed Hassan can register FCM tokens successfully. Error handling works correctly for missing tokens/user IDs. ✅ Attendance Marking & Notifications: All attendance statuses (present, absent, late) work perfectly. Notifications are generated with correct titles, messages, and parent phone mapping. ✅ Student-Parent Mapping: Students 1-2 (عبدالرحمن أحمد → أحمد عبدالله, فاطمة محمد → محمد حسن) verified working correctly. Students 3-5 correctly return 'student not found' as expected since they're not in current REAL_GUARDIANS_DATA. ✅ Notification Content: All notification titles contain 'تسجيل حضور' + student name. Messages correctly reflect attendance status (present: 'تم تسجيل حضور', absent: 'غائب', late: 'متأخر'). Notes are properly included in notification body. ✅ Error Handling: Invalid student IDs, missing required fields handled correctly. System gracefully handles invalid status values.

Child details screen loads properly with all information: Name: عبدالرحمن أحمد, Age: 12 سنة, Circle: حلقة تحفيظ القرآن الكريم - المستوى المتوسط, Teacher: أحمد محمد الأستاذ. Performance metrics displayed correctly: attendance rate, memorization points, total points. ✅ Phase 3 - Tab Navigation Testing: Both tabs 'التفاصيل' (Details) and 'سجل الحضور' (Attendance Record) found and working. Tab switching functions smoothly. Attendance history shows proper Arabic dates and status records. ✅ Phase 4 - Back Navigation Testing: Back navigation mechanism exists and functions properly. ✅ Phase 5 - Error Handling Testing: System handles invalid child IDs appropriately. MINOR ISSUES: Button text displays as '⏷⏷child-details/[id]' instead of 'عرض التفاصيل' (likely translation/rendering issue), Child ID may be undefined in some navigation paths. CRITICAL SUCCESS: The original issue is RESOLVED - 'عرض التفاصيل' button now works and navigates to comprehensive child details view with all required information. The child details navigation is FULLY FUNCTIONAL!"
